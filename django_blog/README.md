Django Blog Project ‚Äì Authentication System and Post Management
Project Overview
This repository contains the code for a Django blog project, developed as part of the Alx_DjangoLearnLab curriculum.

The first phase focused on a secure and user-friendly authentication system. The second phase introduces a full post management system with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

Authentication System Features
The authentication system combines Django's built-in authentication tools with custom views and forms to enhance functionality and user experience.

User Registration ‚Äì UserRegistrationForm extends Django's default user creation form to include an email field.

Login & Logout ‚Äì Uses Django's built-in LoginView and LogoutView for efficient session management.

Profile Management ‚Äì Authenticated users can view and update their profile via a custom UserUpdateForm and a protected profile view.

Blog Post Management Features üìù
This section of the project implements full CRUD functionality for blog posts, using Django's powerful class-based views.

Post Model ‚Äì A custom model to store post data, including title, content, author, and published_date.

Create Posts ‚Äì A CreateView allows logged-in users to create new blog posts.

View Posts ‚Äì Posts are displayed on the home page using a ListView, and individual posts can be viewed in detail using a DetailView.

Update & Delete Posts ‚Äì The UpdateView and DeleteView allow a post's author to edit or remove their own content. These views are protected using LoginRequiredMixin and UserPassesTestMixin to enforce ownership.
